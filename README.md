# Automata.js

Take your DOM as [automatas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata) and have fun!

### Be aware 
This project is under development, and cannot be used in the production environment.

### Introduction
We all know that front end logics are heavily event-driven. Automata.js regard each DOM element with specific behaviors as an automata, which meets the event-driven nature. By saying that, changes in data is just like shifting from one state to another state.

If you are not familiar with automata, checkout [the wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata).
